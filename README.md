## Download

Grab the latest installer from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/khadesh/SpyxysDPSMeter/releases/latest):

```text
SpyxysDPSMeter-Setup-1.X.Y-win-x64.exe
```

Releases are built automatically: bumping the `<Version>` property in
`SpyxysDPSMeter/SpyxysDPSMeter.csproj` on `master` triggers a GitHub Actions
workflow that publishes the app, compiles the installer, and creates a
tagged release.

## Features

### Live EverQuest log monitoring

- Automatically scans the configured folder for files named `eqlog_CHARACTER_SERVER.txt`.
- Selects the newest matching log file by last-write time and file size.
- Reads new log data while EverQuest continues writing to the file.
- Handles log truncation or replacement by reopening the active file.
- Uses a refresh-rate-specific processing cap:
  - `0.2s` — up to 200 lines per poll;
  - `0.5s` — up to 500 lines per poll;
  - `1.0s`, `2.0s`, `3.0s`, or `5.0s` — up to 1,000 lines per poll.
- Retains up to 1,000 recent raw log lines internally.
- Displays the active character and server in the title.

The default log folder is:

```text
C:\Users\Public\Daybreak Game Company\Installed Games\EverQuest Legends\Logs
```

The folder can be changed from:

```text
Gear menu → Log Directory → Change Log Directory...
```

The selected directory is saved in `settings.json`. Use **Revert to Default** to return to the built-in path.

### Refresh rate

The gear menu provides a **Refresh Rate** option that controls how often the meter checks the active EverQuest log for newly appended lines:

- `0.2s`
- `0.5s`
- `1.0s` — default
- `2.0s`
- `3.0s`
- `5.0s`

The selected rate takes effect immediately and is saved in `settings.json`. Its maximum processed lines per poll are:

| Refresh rate | Maximum lines per poll |
|---:|---:|
| `0.2s` | 200 |
| `0.5s` | 500 |
| `1.0s` or slower | 1,000 |

Faster rates make new combat events appear sooner but check the file more often. When the meter is hidden in the Windows system tray, active-log reading temporarily changes to `5.0s`, which uses the 1,000-line cap. Restoring the window immediately returns to the player's selected rate and matching cap without changing the saved setting. The separate scan for a newer character log remains unchanged.

### Damage and DPS

- Groups damage by attacker.
- Calculates DPS from a rolling 30-second damage window.
- Uses at least one second as the divisor to avoid inflated startup values.
- Tracks direct attacks, spell damage, damage-over-time ticks, and damage-shield damage.
- Damage against the player, the player's pet, or a group member immediately classifies the source as hostile.
- Misses, parries, dodges, blocks, and ripostes update recent targeting during an active encounter.
- A kill creates a three-second encounter barrier:
  - damage inside the barrier continues the current encounter;
  - otherwise the encounter is finalized.
- Rows are sorted by total damage, then alphabetically.

### Damage spell-cast indicators

Temporary red indicators appear beside any recognized entity when it begins casting a damage spell:

- `●` — single-target direct-damage spell;
- `○` — single-target damage-over-time spell;
- `■` — AOE or PBAE direct-damage spell;
- `□` — AOE damage-over-time spell.

All four damage indicators are red and remain visible for four seconds. They can appear for the monitored player, group members, pets, enemies, and other parsed casters.

Damage spells are recognized from built-in direct-damage, DoT, and area-damage spell lists, expanded AE/AOE/PBAE spell-family patterns, and spell names learned from actual damage records during the current run. Al'Kabor spiral spells, rain, column, pillar, circle, tears, Jyll's, and other recognized area families use square markers.

The meter also learns area damage dynamically. When the same source and spell damage multiple distinct targets within a short window, that spell is remembered as area damage for the rest of the run. If its current cast indicator is still visible, the meter immediately changes that indicator from a circle to the appropriate filled or hollow square.

### Teleportation spell indicators

Teleportation and evacuation spells use a golden indicator:

- `◆` — Gate, portal, ring, circle, translocate, evacuate, succor, relocation, or another recognized teleportation spell.

The golden indicator remains visible for four seconds. When **Spell Casting Subtext** is enabled, the teleportation spell name is also shown in the same golden hue. Recognized teleportation spells are excluded from damage-spell classification, including teleport spell families whose names begin with `Circle of`.

### Spell-casting subtext

The **Spell Casting Subtext** display option shows the latest spell being cast beneath an entity's name:

```text
casting Complete Healing
```

The spell name is color-coded using the same categories as the meter's other spell indicators:

- healing — green;
- teleportation and evacuation — golden;
- direct damage and damage-over-time — red;
- charm — bright pink;
- root — bright orange;
- lull / pacify — bright red;
- mesmerize — bluish green;
- stun — bright purple;
- otherwise unclassified spells — bright magenta.

The casting line can appear for the monitored player, group members, pets, enemies, and unknown entities when unknown entities are enabled. It remains visible for three seconds. If the same entity starts another spell during that time, the newer spell immediately replaces the previous one.

Casting subtext is displayed as an additional line, so it can remain visible at the same time as main-assist target or target-mismatch subtext. The toggle is saved in `settings.json`.

### Recent-attacker markers

One or more `!` marks after a name show how many distinct attackers damaged that entity during the last five seconds.

Example:

```text
A goblin scout !!!
```

This means three distinct attackers recently damaged that entity.

### Entity classification and row colors

The meter uses distinct row/text colors for:

- the monitored character;
- known or manually tagged group members;
- the monitored character's pet;
- known enemies;
- unclassified entities.

### Data filtering

The former **Unknown Entities** toggle has been replaced by a mutually exclusive **Data Filtering** submenu:

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **All data** | Shows and calculates every parsed entity. Intended for private instances where every combatant is relevant. |
| **Remove unknowns** | Hides unclassified public players and pets while retaining the monitored player, owned pet, group members, manually tagged members, and known enemies. This matches the former Unknown Entities-off behavior. |
| **Only knowns** | Calculates only combat involving the monitored player, owned pet, detected or manually tagged group members, and enemies directly engaged by those protected entities during the current encounter. |

In **Only knowns** mode:

- a non-group entity becomes encounter-scoped only through direct damage, an avoided attack, or a recognized harmful spell involving the player, owned pet, or group;
- once scoped, a damage event is accepted only when both its source and target are protected friendlies or enemies scoped to the current encounter;
- unrelated public players, public pets, and previously known enemies fighting elsewhere are not displayed and do not contribute damage or DPS;
- damage from an unrelated public player to one of the group's scoped enemies is excluded because that public player was never tagged by the protected group;
- switching to this mode during an encounter rebuilds the scope from direct protected-group interactions already recorded in the current fight;
- temporary healing, casting, teleportation, and CC rows are subject to the same final display filter.

The selected mode is saved in `settings.json`. Older settings migrate automatically: `ShowUnknownEntities: true` becomes **All data**, while `false` becomes **Remove unknowns**.

### Immediate hostile classification

An entity is immediately classified as hostile when it:

- deals damage to the monitored character;
- deals damage to the monitored character's pet;
- deals damage to a known or manually tagged group member;
- casts a recognized damaging or crowd-control spell that targets one of those protected entities;
- lands a recognized charm, root, lull, mesmerize, or stun effect on one of those protected entities;
- is directly attacked by the protected group while **Only knowns** is active.

The meter correlates harmful spell effects with recent cast-start messages to identify the caster. The player, owned pets, and known group members are never marked hostile by these rules. Hostile classification happens immediately and no longer waits for the enemy to die.

### Group detection and manual tagging

The meter learns group membership from:

- group invitations and acceptance;
- members joining or leaving;
- group disband/leave messages;
- group chat activity.

The gear menu also provides:

- **Tag Group Member** for manually classifying an unknown entity;
- **Remove Manual Group Member** for removing a manual classification;
- **Always Show Group Members** to keep the player and known group members visible even before they deal damage.

Manual group members are saved in `settings.json`.

### Main assist tools

Right-click a player or group-member row to:

- **Set as Main Assist**
- **Clear Main Assist**

When main-assist indicators are enabled:

- the main assist is underlined and displays a sword icon;
- the main assist's current target appears beneath the name;
- a group member targeting something different displays red target subtext and a flashing warning icon.

The selected main assist is saved between launches.

### Healing indicators

Temporary green indicators appear beside row names:

- `>` — the entity began casting a recognized healing spell;
- `<` — the player or a group member received a heal;
- `<<` — Lay on Hands was received;
- `>>` — the entity cast Lay on Hands on another target.

Timing used by the meter:

| Indicator | Duration |
|---|---:|
| Healing cast `>` | 4 seconds |
| Healing received `<` | 3 seconds |
| Lay on Hands recipient `<<` | 10 seconds |
| Lay on Hands caster `>>` | 12 seconds |

Lay on Hands recipients also receive a flashing green healing label. Multiple temporary indicators can be visible at the same time.

Healing spells are identified from a built-in name list, name fragments, and spell names learned from actual healing log records during the current session.

### Hard crowd-control indicators

The meter recognizes these hard-CC categories:

| Effect | Color |
|---|---|
| Charm | Bright pink |
| Root | Bright orange |
| Lull / Pacify | Bright red |
| Mesmerize | Bluish green |
| Stun | Bright purple |

Indicator shapes:

- `▲` — a normal/single-target CC spell is being cast;
- `■` — a recognized AOE mesmerize or stun is being cast;
- `X` — a target is affected by any recognized CC spell.

Cast indicators appear on the caster for four seconds. Every landed CC effect uses an `X` on the affected target for six seconds, colored according to the CC category. This applies to the monitored player, allies, enemies, and every other recognized target. Temporary indicators fade near expiration.

Recognized CC targets are temporarily added to the table even when they have no damage row.

### Experience tracking

The title can display:

- **XP/h** — experience gained over the current monitored login/session;
- **Last 10 XP/h** — an estimate based on the most recent ten experience gains.

### Platinum tracking

The meter reads currency received from corpses and loot-sale messages.

Two rate modes are available:

- **Normal** — uses retained currency and elapsed time;
- **3m Throttled** — uses a minimum three-minute calculation window to reduce extreme early-session values.

Currency history is retained for up to one hour.

### Display options

The gear menu can toggle:

- player name;
- server name;
- XP/h;
- Last 10 XP/h;
- Platinum/h;
- data filtering mode;
- always-visible group members;
- main-assist indicators;
- spell-casting subtext;
- active-log refresh rate.

Damage and DPS numbers can be aligned left or right.

### In-app help

Open the gear menu and choose:

```text
Help → Feature Guide...
```

The scrollable in-app feature guide explains log monitoring, refresh-rate line caps, all three data-filtering modes, damage and spell indicators, teleportation, casting subtext, entity classification, hostile detection, group tools, main assist, healing, crowd control, XP, platinum, display settings, system-tray behavior, reset behavior, settings, and troubleshooting.

The same **Help** submenu also provides **Open GitHub Project**.

### System tray

- Closing the window hides the meter to the Windows system tray.
- Double-clicking the tray icon restores the window.
- The tray menu provides **Show Spyxy's DPS Meter** and **Exit**.
- Timers and log monitoring continue while the window is hidden.
- While hidden, the active-log refresh interval temporarily changes to `5.0s` to reduce background activity.
- Restoring the window immediately reapplies the refresh rate selected in the gear menu.
- Launching a second copy restores the existing window and immediately closes the new process before it reads any logs.

### Reset button

The reset button clears current:

- damage and DPS;
- encounter state;
- XP tracking;
- platinum tracking;
- target history;
- current Only knowns encounter scope;
- temporary healing, teleportation, damage-spell, spell-casting subtext, and CC indicators.

It does not erase saved application settings.

### GitHub shortcut

The lower-right corner of the meter always displays **Spyxy's DPS**.

- Hovering shows the full GitHub address.
- Clicking opens the project page in the default browser.

## Getting started

1. Enable EverQuest logging:

   ```text
   /log on
   ```

2. Start Spyxy's DPS Meter.
3. The meter will search the configured log directory for the newest matching log.
4. When necessary, choose another folder from:

   ```text
   Gear menu → Log Directory → Change Log Directory...
   ```

5. Enter combat and watch the table update.

## Settings

Settings are serialized as JSON to:

```text
<application folder>\settings.json
```

The settings file includes display preferences, the selected data-filtering mode, platinum mode, manual group members, main assist, the spell-casting subtext toggle, the active-log refresh rate, the selected log directory, and the saved window position and size.

Example log-directory setting:

```json
{
  "LogDirectory": "D:\\Games\\EverQuest Legends\\Logs"
}
```

Example data-filtering setting:

```json
{
  "DataFilteringMode": "OnlyKnowns"
}
```

Older `ShowUnknownEntities` values remain readable and are migrated automatically.

## Building

The project is a Windows WPF application targeting the .NET Windows desktop runtime.

Recommended tools:

- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- Visual Studio with the .NET desktop development workload
- .NET 10 SDK, matching the current project target

Typical command-line build:

```powershell
dotnet restore
dotnet build -c Release
```

Typical self-contained Windows x64 publish:

```powershell
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true
```

## Troubleshooting

### No log file is detected

- Confirm logging is enabled with `/log on`.
- Open the gear menu and verify the configured log directory.
- Confirm the selected folder contains a file named like:

  ```text
  eqlog_Character_server.txt
  ```

- Use **Revert to Default** if EverQuest Legends is installed in the standard public location.

### The meter is reading the wrong character

The meter selects the newest matching log file. Make the desired character's log the newest by logging into that character or writing a new log line.

### Settings do not save

Confirm the application folder is writable. The current code stores `settings.json` beside the executable.

### An indicator does not appear

Log parsing depends on the exact text written by EverQuest Legends. Capture the relevant raw log lines when reporting an unrecognized spell, heal, CC effect, or combat message.
